# Project Name: Tickets-Management-System

## Description
This project consists of two parts:

1. **Backend API (Node.js with Express)**: A server that handles requests for a list of tickets, supports pagination, and customizes the data based on the user type (e.g., "local" or "tourist").
2. **Frontend (React)**: A frontend application that interacts with the backend API, displays the tickets, allows users to search and filter them, and supports infinite scrolling.

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the backend directory.
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Server

```bash
node src/server.js
